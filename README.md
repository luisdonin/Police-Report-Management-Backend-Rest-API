The Web API was implemented using Jersey (JAX-RS) and Spring Boot in a Maven project. Additionally, 
a web interface was developed with HTML using Thymeleaf as the view layer in a Java Spring web application to integrate with the API. 
The interface starts on a main page that introduces the system and provides both user registration and listing functionalities on the same page. 
Data persistence is handled with MongoDB using JPA MongoRepository.
